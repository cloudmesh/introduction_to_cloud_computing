Cloudmesh Client
****************************************

We have developed a simplified cloudmesh client. It is known under the name "cloudmesh_client" sometimes we refer to it also as cloudmesh. In future we may change the name from cloudmesh client to cloudmesh. However, at this time it should not be confused with the old cloudmesh.

We have seperated the documentation into a new Web page that is maintaned at

http://cloudmesh.github.io/client/

In case you need an account on Futuresystems, you still can follow the instructions from

http://cloudmesh.github.io/introduction_to_cloud_computing/accounts
